TODO:
1. Bounds checking in all functions that take bit_index as input.
2. Add set_bit_map : sets all bits to 1
3. Add complement_bit_map: flips all bits from their current value. 1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1.
4. add complement_bit
5. Make print_bits print only the number of bits the user asked for instead of all the bits in memory.
